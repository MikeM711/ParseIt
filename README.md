# ParseIt
A web app that enables the user to parse their own text

## Work in progress

Currently working on the frontend

## My notes: Future bugs

The way things are set up, the user should not input `)" "(` in the "replace character" module, or in the "ParseIt Code" module for the "replace character" module
